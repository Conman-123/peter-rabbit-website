					<h3>About the Book</h3>
					<section>
						<p>The first writings about Peter Rabbit were in a letter Beatrix Potter wrote to one of the children of her former governess. Seven years later, Potter used the story and illustrations from this letter to inspire a full version of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Unfortunately, her book was rejected by six different publishers, so she decided to publish the book herself. After some success, she worked out a contract with publisher Frederick Warne & Co., and her book was published.</p>

					<h3>About the Author</h3>
					<section>
						<p>Beatrix Potter was born in London in 1866 and began her endeavours as an artist at a young age, sketching animals and plants. She was later enrolled in the National Art Training School, where she performed well, but remained sceptical about the benefits of formal art training.</p>
						<p>In her 20s, Potter grew to be a talented naturalist. However, after her first paper was not taken seriously by the Linnean Society (probably on accounts of her gender) she decided to focus her efforts on her art.</p>
						<p>Beatrix Potterâ€™s work as an author and illustrator was first hinted at in 1983, where she wrote about Peter Rabbit in one of her letters to the children of her former governess. From this letter she based the ideas and illustrations for her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit.</p>
						<p>From here she continued her writing, until her eyesight began to fail from 1920 onwards, preventing her from doing as much creative work. Her last book was published in 1930. Potter lived out the rest of her life on her estate, where she died in 1943.</p>
